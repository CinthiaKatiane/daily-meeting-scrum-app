<h4> Description: </h4>
<p>In conventional stand-up meetings, the team meets at a certain time (before starting work) and each member answers the standard questions of the daily scrum routine, which are: 
<ul>
<li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
<li>What will you do today?</li>
<li>Are there any impediments in your way?</li>
</ul>
<p>But this approach runs into some difficulties, especially with geographically dispersed teams that can't find an ideal time for everyone to meet before starting work. Another problem is that the team and especially the leadership rely on memory or notes to remember everyone's state and needs.</p>
<p> In conclusion, this app intends to help teams that work remotely to centralize the recording of their daily "stand-up meetings", but also individuals who want an organized and simple system to record and consult the progress of their work.</p>
